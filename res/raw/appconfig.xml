Maria: Some cost 15 dollars... one, five... and some cost 50 dollars?

Kathy: That's right.

Maria: That's a good question. Some dresses are very expensive. Other dresses don't cost very much. They're in-expensive. Some inexpensive dresses come from poor countries...  Countries where workers don't make much money. So costs are low, and prices are low. In rich countries, where workers make a lot of money, costs are high and prices are high.

Kathy: What about materials?

Maria: Yes, that's a good point. Expensive dresses use expensive materials. Silk is expensive, so silk dresses are expensive. Cotton is less expensive than silk. So, cotton dresses are less expensive than silk dresses.</viewscript>

				<viewscript>Kathy: Our guest today is Richard Chen. Richard is a teacher. He teaches math. Welcome back, Richard.
				
Richard: It's nice to see you again.

Kathy: Let's talk today about your work. You're a math teacher, aren't you?

Richard: That's right. I teach math and science.

Kathy: Numbers are important in math and science, aren't they?

Richard: Certainly. Scientists use numbers all the time. And mathematics is the study of numbers.

Kathy: Do you like teaching math?

Richard: Yes, I do. I teach math at college. And once a month, I teach math at my son's school.

Kathy: Your son ... is five years old?

Richard: That's right. He's in primary school.

Kathy: Can little children learn math?

Richard: Well, yes. I show them easy math.

Kathy: For example...

Richard: Well, for example: 1 plus 1 equals 2. I put a doll on a table... one doll. One doll is on the table. Then I put another doll on the table. Two dolls.  Two dolls are now on the table. One doll plus one doll equals two dolls. One plus one equals two.

Kathy: I see. Very interesting. One and one is two. One plus one equals two. That's addition.</viewscript>

				<viewscript>Kathy: One plus one equals two. That's addition. What about subtraction? Four minus one equals three? Do you teach subtraction to young children?
				
Richard: Yes, I do. I teach "take away."

Kathy: Take away?

Richard: Yes. For example... I put four dolls on the table. Four dolls are on the table. Then I take away one doll. Now there are three dolls on the table.

Kathy: First you have four dolls. Then you take away one doll. Then you have three dolls.

Richard: That's right. In the language of mathematics, four... minus one... equals three.

Kathy: I see.

Richard: So... five dolls minus two dolls equals ....

Kathy: ... Three dolls.

Richard: That's right. Five... minus two... equals three.

Kathy: And children understand this?

Richard: Yes, they do. For them, it's a game.

Carol: Hello. My name is Carol. I'm from Sioux City. I have a question for Richard.

Richard: Yes, go ahead.

Carol: How do you teach multiplication to children? 

Richard: I try to make it easy for them. For example, I give two dolls to three different children: Betsy, John, and Sara. Now, Betsy has two dolls. John has two dolls. And Sara has two dolls. Two plus two plus two equals six. That's addition.
         But we can also say: 
		 Three children. 
		 Each child has two dolls. 
		 So there are six dolls all together. 
		 Three... times two... equals... six. 
		 Three children... times two dolls... equals six dolls. 
		 Three times two equals six.
